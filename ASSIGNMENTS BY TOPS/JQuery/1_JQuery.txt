Q_1 What is jQuery?

ans:-

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. Here are some key features and uses of jQuery:

1. DOM Manipulation: jQuery makes it easy to select and manipulate HTML elements and their attributes.
2. Event Handling: jQuery provides a straightforward way to handle events such as clicks, form submissions, and mouse movements.
3. AJAX Support: jQuery simplifies making asynchronous HTTP requests to update web pages without reloading them.
4. Animations and Effects: jQuery includes a variety of built-in methods for creating animations and effects.
5. Cross-Browser Compatibility: jQuery handles the differences between browsers, allowing developers to write code that works consistently across all major browsers.
6. Plugins: jQuery has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality.

Example usage of jQuery:

=====html=====

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>jQuery Example</title>
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $("button").click(function(){
        $("p").hide();
      });
    });
  </script>
</head>
<body>

<button>Click me to hide paragraphs</button>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

==============

In this example, jQuery is used to hide all paragraphs when the button is clicked. The $ function is shorthand for jQuery, and $(document).ready ensures that the code runs after the document is fully loaded.
