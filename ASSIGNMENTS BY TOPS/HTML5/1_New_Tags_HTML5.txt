Q_1 What are the new tags added in HTML5?


ans:-

HTML5 introduced several new tags to enhance the semantics and functionality of web pages. Here are some of the notable new tags:

=> Structural Elements
1. <header>: Represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
2. <nav>: Defines a set of navigation links.
3. <section>: Represents a section of a document, typically with a heading.
4. <article>: Specifies independent, self-contained content.
5. <aside>: Defines content aside from the content it is placed in, often used for sidebars.
6. <footer>: Represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.

=> Media Elements
1. <audio>: Used to embed sound content in documents.
2. <video>: Used to embed video content in documents.
3. <source>: Specifies multiple media resources for media elements (<audio> and <video>).
4. <track>: Specifies text tracks for media elements (<audio> and <video>).

=> Form Elements
1. <datalist>: Contains a set of <option> elements that represent the permissible or suggested options available to other controls.
2. <keygen>: Generates a key pair (public/private). (Note: Deprecated in HTML 5.2)
3. <output>: Represents the result of a calculation or user action.

=> Graphics Elements
1. <canvas>: Used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).
2. <svg>: Defines vector-based graphics.

=> Other Semantic Elements
1. <figure>: Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
2. <figcaption>: Provides a caption for a <figure> element.
3. <mark>: Represents text highlighted for reference purposes.
4. <progress>: Represents the progress of a task.
5. <meter>: Represents a scalar measurement within a known range, or a fractional value.
6. <time>: Represents a specific period in time.
7. <main>: Represents the main content of the document.
8. <template>: Holds client-side content that you donâ€™t want to be rendered when the page loads but can be instantiated later using JavaScript.
9. <details>: Specifies additional details that the user can view or hide.
10. <summary>: Defines a visible heading for the <details> element.

These new elements help in creating a more structured and semantically rich HTML document, which is easier to understand and style with CSS, and more accessible for assistive technologies.
