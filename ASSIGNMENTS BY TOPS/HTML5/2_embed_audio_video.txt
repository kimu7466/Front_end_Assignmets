Q_2 How to embed audio and video in a webpage?

ans :-

Embedding audio and video in a webpage is straightforward with HTML5. You use the "<audio>" and "<video>" elements, respectively. Here are the basic steps and examples for both:

=> Embedding Audio

You can embed audio using the "<audio>" tag. You can include multiple sources to provide fallback options in different formats. Common audio formats include MP3, Ogg, and WAV.

=> Example:
=====HTML=====
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Embed Audio</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Audio Example</h1>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="audio-file.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
</body>
</html>
==============

=> Embedding Video

The "<video>" tag is used to embed video. You can also include multiple sources for fallback in different formats. Common video formats include MP4, WebM, and Ogg.

=> Example:
=====HTML=====
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Embed Video</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Video Example</h1>
    <video width="600" controls>
        <source src="video-file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="video-file.webm" type="video/webm">
        <source src="video-file.ogv" type="video/ogg">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</body>
</html>
==============

=> Attributes for "<audio>" and "<video>" Tags

- "controls": Adds play, pause, and volume controls.
- "autoplay": The media starts playing as soon as it is loaded.
- "loop": The media will start over again, every time it is finished.
- "muted": The audio output of the media is muted.
- "preload": Specifies if and how the author thinks the media file should be loaded when the page loads ("none", "metadata", or "auto").

=> Example with All Attributes:

=> Audio:
=====HTML=====
<audio controls autoplay loop muted>
    <source src="audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="audio-file.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
==============

=> Video:
=====HTML=====
<video width="600" controls autoplay loop muted>
    <source src="video-file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="video-file.webm" type="video/webm">
    <source src="video-file.ogv" type="video/ogg">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
==============

These tags provide a simple and effective way to include audio and video content directly in HTML5 web pages.
