2 :- What is promises

ans :- 

Promises are a feature in JavaScript that provide a way to handle asynchronous operations. They represent a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never. Promises allow you to write cleaner and more manageable asynchronous code, avoiding the "callback hell" often associated with nested callbacks.

 Key Concepts of Promises:

1. States:
   A promise can be in one of three states:
   - Pending: The initial state; the operation has not completed yet.
   - Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, resulting in a value.
   - Rejected: The operation failed, resulting in a reason (error).

2. Creating a Promise:
   You create a promise using the `Promise` constructor. It takes a function (executor) with two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`.
   >>>javascript<<<
   const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       // Asynchronous operation
       if (/* operation successful */) {
           resolve('Success!'); // Fulfilled
       } else {
           reject('Error!'); // Rejected
       }
   });
   >>><>||||<><<<

3. Using Promises:
   You can handle the resolved or rejected value of a promise using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` methods:
   >>>javascript<<<
   myPromise
       .then(result => {
           console.log(result); // Handle fulfilled promise
       })
       .catch(error => {
           console.error(error); // Handle rejected promise
       })
       .finally(() => {
           console.log('Promise settled (either fulfilled or rejected).');
       });
   >>><>||||<><<<

4. Chaining Promises:
   Promises can be chained to perform a series of asynchronous operations, with each `.then()` returning a new promise:
   >>>javascript<<<
   fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
       .then(response => response.json()) // Process the response
       .then(data => {
           console.log(data); // Use the data
       })
       .catch(error => {
           console.error('Error:', error); // Handle errors
       });
   >>><>||||<><<<

5. Promise.all():
   You can execute multiple promises in parallel using `Promise.all()`, which resolves when all promises are fulfilled, or rejects if any promise is rejected:
   >>>javascript<<<
   Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
       .then(results => {
           console.log(results); // Array of results
       })
       .catch(error => {
           console.error('One or more promises failed:', error);
       });
   >>><>||||<><<<

 Benefits of Promises:
- Readability: Promises provide a cleaner syntax for handling asynchronous operations compared to callbacks.
- Error Handling: They make it easier to handle errors across asynchronous calls.
- Chaining: Promises allow you to chain operations, making your code more organized.

 Conclusion:
Promises are a powerful tool for managing asynchronous code in JavaScript. They help to write more maintainable and understandable code by providing a clear structure for handling asynchronous operations and their results.
