Q :- Will alert be shown? 
if ("0") { alert( 'Hello'); }


ans :-

Yes, the alert('Hello') will be shown.

Explanation:
- The condition inside the if statement is "0", which is a non-empty string.
- In JavaScript, any non-empty string is considered truthy, meaning it will evaluate to true when used in a conditional statement.
- Therefore, since "0" is truthy, the code inside the if block will execute, and the alert('Hello') will be shown.
