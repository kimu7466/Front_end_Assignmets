What is the code below going to output? alert( null || 2 || undefined );

ans :-

The code alert( null || 2 || undefined ); will output:- 2

Explanation:-

The || (logical OR) operator in JavaScript returns the first truthy value it encounters, or the last value if none are truthy. Here's how it evaluates in this case:

1. null is falsy.
2. 2 is truthy.
3. Since 2 is truthy, the evaluation stops there, and 2 is returned.

Thus, the alert will display 2.
