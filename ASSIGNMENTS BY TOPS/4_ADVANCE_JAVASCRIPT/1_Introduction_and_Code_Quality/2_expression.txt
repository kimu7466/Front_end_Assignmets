What will be the result for these expressions? 
1. 5 > 4 
2. "apple" > "pineapple" 
3. "2" > "12" 
4.  undefined == null 
5.  undefined === null 
6. null == "\n0\n" 
7. 7. null === +"\n0\n"


ans:-


Here are the results for each of the given expressions:

1. 5 > 4  
   Result: true  
   Explanation: 5 is greater than 4, so this returns true.

2. "apple" > "pineapple"  
   Result: false  
   Explanation: String comparison is done lexicographically. Since "a" comes before "p", "apple" is not greater than "pineapple", so it returns false.

3. "2" > "12"  
   Result: true  
   Explanation: Strings are compared lexicographically. "2" is greater than "12" because in a character-by-character comparison, "2" is greater than "1" (since "2" comes after "1").

4. undefined == null  
   Result: true  
   Explanation: In JavaScript, undefined and null are considered equal when using == because they are both considered "empty" values.

5. undefined === null  
   Result: false  
   Explanation: The strict equality operator === checks both value and type. Since undefined and null are of different types, this returns false.

6. null == "\n0\n"  
   Result: false  
   Explanation: null only loosely equals undefined, and does not loosely equal any other value, so this returns false.

7. null === +"\n0\n"  
   Result: false  
   Explanation: +"\n0\n" converts to the number 0, and null is not strictly equal to 0, so this returns false.
