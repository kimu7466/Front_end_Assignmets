Q:- What is JavaScript Output method?
Q:- How to used JavaScript Output method?

ans:-

JavaScript output methods are ways to display data or information to the user. JavaScript provides several methods to output data, each suited for different purposes. Below are the most common JavaScript output methods:

 1. console.log()
   - This method is used to display data or messages in the browser's console, mainly for debugging purposes.
   - Use Case: Developers commonly use this to check values or diagnose issues while writing JavaScript code.

   >>>JAVASCRIPT<<<
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   console.log(5 + 10);
   <<<<<<>>>>>>

   Output will be shown in the browser console (can be accessed via browser's Developer Tools).

 2. document.write()
   - This method writes content directly into the HTML document.
   - Use Case: It's often used for testing purposes or dynamically generating content in simple HTML pages. However, it's not recommended for modern web development since it can overwrite existing content if used after the page has loaded.

   >>>JAVASCRIPT<<<
   document.write("Hello, World!");
   document.write(5 + 10);
   <<<<<<>>>>>>

   Output will appear directly in the browser window.

 3. alert()
   - This method displays an alert box with a message and an OK button.
   - Use Case: It's useful for showing simple messages or warnings to users but should be used sparingly since it blocks user interaction until the alert is closed.

   >>>JAVASCRIPT<<<
   alert("Hello, World!");
   <<<<<<>>>>>>

   Output will be shown in an alert dialog box.

 4. innerHTML
   - This method sets or returns the HTML content of an element on the page. It's used to manipulate the content of specific HTML elements dynamically.
   - Use Case: It's commonly used in modern web development to update the content of web pages dynamically.

   >>>JAVASCRIPT<<<
   document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
   <<<<<<>>>>>>

   HTML:
   <<<html>>>
   <div id="output"></div>
   <<<<<<>>>>>>

   This will insert "Hello, World!" into the <div> with the id output.

 5. window.print()
   - This method opens the print dialog box for the current page, allowing users to print the content.
   - Use Case: It's used when you want to provide an option to print the page or certain sections of it.

   >>>JAVASCRIPT<<<
   window.print();
   <<<<<<>>>>>>

   Output will open the browser's print dialog for the user.

 6. prompt()
   - This method displays a dialog box that asks the user for input and returns that input as a string.
   - Use Case: You can use it when you need simple user input.

   >>>JAVASCRIPT<<<
   var name = prompt("What is your name?");
   console.log("Hello, " + name);
   <<<<<<>>>>>>

   Output will show an input dialog box to ask the user for their name.

 7. confirm()
   - This method displays a confirmation dialog box with OK and Cancel buttons, returning true if OK is pressed and false if Cancel is pressed.
   - Use Case: It's used when you need to confirm user actions (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this?").

   >>>JAVASCRIPT<<<
   var result = confirm("Are you sure?");
   console.log(result); // true if OK, false if Cancel
   <<<<<<>>>>>>
